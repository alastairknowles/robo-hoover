###Robo Hoover

Small application developed to demonstrate my engineering skills

Contains a full test suite covering all major functions, CD to the project directory and ./gradlew clean build to run them. Alternatively run the application using ./gradlew bootRun from the project directly to start listening on 8080. Then hit localhost:8080/hoover/instructions/input with an appropriately formatted request to try it out.

The input format can be understood by looking into the HooverInputDto object.
